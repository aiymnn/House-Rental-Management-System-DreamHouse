# Dream House - House Rental Management System

Dream House is a web-based House Rental Management System designed to streamline the rental process between landlords and tenants. The system allows landlords to list available properties, manage rental details, and track tenant information, while tenants can browse listings, submit rental applications, and make payments online. This project focuses on improving the efficiency, transparency, and user experience in the house rental process.
